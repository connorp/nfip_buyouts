- corrected instrument problem (insufficient variation in the instruments with all the lags)
  - even with corrected specification and no lags, still insufficient variation for good identification
- can't add more pre-period leads (can't even have both F1 and L3 in the same regression) due to timing of instrument
- clarified adaptation in text
- clarified estimating equation and unit of analysis
- included results of first stage regression
- don't need to drop a tau because we weren't saturating the possible event periods
- added Diff in Diff style regression in addition to event study
- updated summary statistics by adaptation status and flooded/unflooded in sample
- not clustering by year since most flood events were from a handful of years (mostly Hurricane matthew in 2016)
- not doing event study graphs because the estimates are bad
- agree with Abdou's point about post-sale insurance takeup, need better data wrangling
